# Beavercreek Robotics

  Welcome to Beavercreek Robotics Club.  This page is here to help our robotics programmers.  Our goals are:
  
  1. Share code among our teams
  2. Help our teams track their code and issues
  3. Give new team programmers a place to learn from the experts

We can work together to add [resources](/resources) for eachother to use and [quickstart](/quickstart) instructions for new coders.
