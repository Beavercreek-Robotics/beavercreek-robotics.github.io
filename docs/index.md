# Welcome

Welcome to Beavercreek Robotics Club.  This page is here to help our robotics programmers.  Our goals are:
  
  1. Share code among our teams
  2. Help our teams track their code and issues
  3. Give new team programmers a place to learn from the experts

We can work together to add [resources](/resources/) for each other to use and [quickstart](/quickstart/) instructions for new coders.

# Benefits to Students

If you are considering a career in programming, many developers maintain a portfolio of their work. Now is a great time to get started.  Impress future employers with the fact you were writing advanced code **as a student in middle school or high school.**

Have you ever made a mistake and bricked your code so bad you don't know how to fix it?  Tracking version of your code in github and committing frequently lets you roll back to any previous version of your code.  You can even **tag** working versions of your code so you know which one to grab.

If you're working with another coder, github can keep you from stepping on each others' toes.  Git will automatically track all the changes each developer makes and merge them into a single code base.

Do you need a better way to keep track of your teams' "wish list?" Use github issues to track, prioritize, and work on the features your teammates ask for.
