## Welcome

Welcome to Beavercreek Robotics Club.  This page is here to help our robotics programmers.  Our goals are:
  
  1. Share code among our teams
  2. Help our teams track their code and issues
  3. Give new team programmers a place to learn from the experts

We can work together to add [resources](/resources/) for each other to use and [quickstart](/quickstart/) instructions for new coders.

## Benefits to Students

If you are considering a career in programming, many developers maintain a portfolio of their work. Now is a great time to get started.  Impress future employers with the fact you were writing advanced code **as a student in middle school or high school.**
