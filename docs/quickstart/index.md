# Beavercreek Coding Quickstart

## Prerequisitites  

Before you can create a project and clone it to your computer, you'll need to complete these steps:

1. With your parent's permission, setup your own user account on [github](https://github.com). For the rest of these steps, we assume you are logged into github.
2. Request to join our [Beavercreek Robotics team site](https://github.com/Beavercreek-Robotics)
3. If you are using a Windows computer, install [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/). Note that you might need to reboot.
4. Install one of the VEXcode Options:
  a. The [VS Code Extension](https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode/vscode-extension) which requires installing [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  b. Install the [VEXcode Pro V5](https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode/install/v5)

## Starting a New Robot Project

1. Create a project for your team to use this year. The project name should include:
  a. The competition season
  b. Your team name
2. In the project on github, copy the https link to your repository as shown here: ![Click code, then https](static/github-code-https.png)
3. Browse to a folder on your computer where you want to store your code.  Right-click in that folder and chose clone: ![Context menu showing tortoise git Clone](static/tortoise-git-clone.png)
4. Tortoise Git should auto-populate with your project's url and recommend creating a subdirectory to clone into. Make sure you're happy with that setting and click OK. ![Tortoise git Clone dialog](static/tortoise-git-clone-dialog.png)

You should now have a directory that's either empty or has a README.md file in it.

## Opening Your Project in VEXcode Pro

In `VEXCode Pro`, Open the directory where you cloned your project and begin to code.
